## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart

Get started with your modern Python package in just a few steps:

### 1. Install Dependendencies

#### pip

On Ubuntu 24.04

```sh
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

#### [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx)

Ubuntu 24.04: 
[Pipx official  installation instructions](https://github.com/pypa/pipx#install-pipx) leads to installing an old version. [This discussion](https://github.com/pypa/pipx/issues/1481) suggests using pipx to install pipx

```sh
sudo apt install pipx               # installs pipx version 1.4.3 to /usr/local/bin  recall --global is busted
pipx ensurepath                     # adds ~/.local/bin to path
pipx install pipx                   # installs latest pipx to ~/.local/bin 
sudo apt purge --autoremove pipx    # remove pipx 1.4.3 via apt,  and all extra files including autocomplete from /usr/local/bin

# restart shell
```


#### [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

If you haven't installed Cookiecutter yet, make sure to have version 1.4.0 or higher:

```sh
pipx install cookiecutter
cookiecutter --version
```

#### [cruft](https://cruft.github.io/cruft/)

```sh
pipx install cruft
```

#### [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)

```sh
pipx install poetry
```

### 2. Generate your Python Package

Run cruft using the latest release

```sh
cruft create gh:response42/cookiecutter-pypackage
```

### 3. Set up Your Project

Follow these steps to complete the setup:

* Create a new GitHub repository and push your generated project there.
* Install the development requirements into a virtual environment:

    ```sh
    poetry install
    ```

* Install pre-commit hooks:

    ```sh
    poetry run inv install-hooks
    ```

* Configure [Codecov][codecov] repository settings. (Codecov App, `CODECOV_TOKEN`)
* Add your repository to your [Read the Docs][rtd] account and enable the Read the Docs service hook.
* Configure [PyPI][pypi] and [TestPyPI][testpypi] tokens. (`PYPI_TOKEN`, `TEST_PYPI_TOKEN`)
* Release your package by pushing a new tag.
